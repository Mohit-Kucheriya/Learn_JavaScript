# Javascript & classes

## JavaScript is primarly a prototype based language

## OOP

### Object: collections of properties and method.

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- instance (new, this)

## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism 

### Notes:
## step 1: 'new' keyword creates a new empty object (which is called 'instances')
## step 2: with the 'new' keyword constructor function is called. It takes all the arguments passed.
## step 3: 'this' keyword gets attached with it.

# Note: Everything in Javascript is object
